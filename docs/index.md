**Scalable Task Execution and Async I/O Core**

Saturn is a high-performance library offering a unified foundation for building concurrent applications. It provides two core modules: a lightweight **Task Executor** for structured concurrency and a low-level **Asynchronous I/O** engine designed for speed and scalability on modern systems.

If you need more functionality or code coverage, Please create an issue at [**Saturn Repo**](https://github.com/bitlaab-blitz/saturn) and buy us some coffee.
